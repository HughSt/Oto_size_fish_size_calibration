Predicting juvenile salmon forklength from otoliths
================

This is a working example of how to reconstruct the forklength (FL) of juvenile Chinook salmon from otolith radius measurements. You will need the `segmented` package as we are going to fit a segmented/broken stick regression model.

If you wish to apply the relationship to your own otolith radius measurements it is important to use the 90 degree transect starting at the most dorsal-posterior primordium (see figure below). Also note that all samples used in the calibration are fall run Chinook salmon from the California Central Valley and individuals from other Evolutionarily Significant Units may exhibit a significantly different relationship (Zabel et al. 2010. Environmental Biology of Fishes, 89, p.267-78)

``` r
library(segmented)
library(scales)
```

Load in the data

``` r
calib = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annasturrock/Oto_size_fish_size_calibration/master/OR_FL_FINALforR.csv")
```

This contains x, y and z...

``` r
head(calib)
```

    ##   Sample_ID N_LOC                           Site HvW Year  OR     FL
    ## 1     VE554   CNH Coleman National Fish Hatchery   H 2002 246 28.248
    ## 2     VE271   CNH Coleman National Fish Hatchery   H 2002 267 28.711
    ## 3     VE268   CNH Coleman National Fish Hatchery   H 2002 256 28.716
    ## 4     VE234   CNH Coleman National Fish Hatchery   H 2002 261 29.189
    ## 5     VE381   CNH Coleman National Fish Hatchery   H 2002 238 29.263
    ## 6     VE235   CNH Coleman National Fish Hatchery   H 2002 292 29.285

Now subset the data, using only the `ID`, `OR` (otolith radius) and `FL` (fork length) columns.

``` r
calib <- subset(calib, select=c("Sample_ID","OR","FL"))
FL <- calib$FL
OR <- calib$OR
```

We are now going to fix the y intercept at 30 mm as size at first feeding (~32mm) fitted the data and reflected literature (Titus et al 2004). \# Without this action the first segment had an negative slope (an artefact of the patchy calibration data between 25 and 35mm FL).

``` r
forced.intercept <- 30
```

Now fit the segmented regression

``` r
res.lm <- lm(I(FL-forced.intercept) ~ 0 + OR)
res.bs <- segmented(res.lm, seg.Z = ~ 0 + OR)
res.bs
```

    ## Call: segmented.lm(obj = res.lm, seg.Z = ~0 + OR)
    ## 
    ## Meaningful coefficients of the linear terms:
    ##      OR    U1.OR  
    ## 0.01334  0.15989  
    ## 
    ## Estimated Break-Point(s):
    ## psi1.OR  
    ##     264

Having fit the model, we can obtain fitted values as follows

``` r
FL.bs <- predict(res.bs) + forced.intercept
plot(FL.bs,FL)
```

To show the fitted line, we can order the OR values and plot a line

``` r
plot(FL ~ OR, data = calib, pch = 16, col = alpha("black", 0.7),type = "p", ylab = "Fork length (mm)", 
     xlab = "Otolith radius (Âµm)", las = 1, cex.lab = 1.3) #main = "Fork length prediction"
points(FL.bs[order(OR)] ~ OR[order(OR)], col = "red", pch = 16, type = "l", lwd = 2.5)
text(198,128,"A", cex = 2)
```

We can also calculate the residuals before and after the breakpoint.

``` r
resid.segm <- FL - FL.bs
resid_small <- resid.segm[OR < res.bs$psi[2]]
resid_large <- resid.segm[OR >= res.bs$psi[2]]
SD1 <- round(sd(resid.segm[OR < res.bs$psi[2]]),2)
SD2 <- round(sd(resid.segm[OR >= res.bs$psi[2]]),2)
```

And then plot those using boxplots

``` r
boxplot(resid.segm[OR < res.bs$psi[2]], resid.segm[OR >= res.bs$psi[2]], names = c("Before breakpoint", "After breakpoint"), col = "light grey", 
        las = 1, ylim = c(-25, 27), xlab = "Residual error", outpch=16, outcol=alpha("black", 0.7), ylab = "Residual value", cex.lab = 1.3) #, main = "Broken stick models residuals"
text(1, -25, bquote(~ sigma[r] == .(SD1)))
text(2, -25, bquote(~ sigma[r] == .(SD2)))
text(0.58,25,"B", cex = 2)
```
